# Practicing Packet Communication with C

This repository is for learning the basics of **packet-based communication using C language**.  
To deepen my understanding of how data transmission works under the hood, I'm building a simple TCP server and client from scratch using low-level socket APIs.

## What I'm Practicing
- Creating sockets and setting up TCP connections in C
- Basic server-client communication
- Using functions like `socket()`, `bind()`, `listen()`, `accept()`, `connect()`, `read()`, and `send()`
- Implementing a simple two-way message exchange (like a chat)

## Purpose
The goal is to **get hands-on experience with how network communication actually works**, especially at the lower levels.  
By coding everything manually in C, I want to build a solid foundation for understanding how packets are sent, received, and handled in real-world applications.

This project is part of my personal study to explore computer networking and deepen my knowledge through building things step-by-step.
